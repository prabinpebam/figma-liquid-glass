We will be making a complex plugin and will need scalable file and folder structure for js. So keep that in mind.

Now we need to start by putting place some fundamental functionality.

We need the following fucntionality.
- For a selected shape/object in Figma, we need to capture everything under the shape as an image. The image should be captured with a certain amount of external offset from the bounding box of the shape.

We need a button that says capture image.
After selecting a shape in Figma and clicking this button will capture the image as described above and display it in the plugin UI.
